  abstract = {We present a machine learning framework for evaluating stock price accuracy and predicting next-day prices. Our methodology assesses present price correctness in both percentage and absolute terms, forecasts future prices using models including ARIMA and Random Forest Regression, and generates actionable investment recommendations (Buy/Hold/Sell). We further analyze the impact of prediction errors on an investment portfolio. Experimental results on real-time data from Alpha Vantage and Yahoo Finance demonstrate high accuracy in price prediction (up to 99.01\%) and provide valuable insights for strategic investment decision-making.},
