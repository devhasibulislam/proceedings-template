    abstract = {We researched how our thesis can help guess stock prices and suggest smart investment moves. We check if the current stock prices are right, predict the next day prices, and give practical advice in three categories: Sell, Hold, and Buy. We also examine the effects of wrong predictions on investment portfolios.},
